# C-Plus-Plus-Critical
This is the first time I try to utilize github for developing some program for both self-learning and sharing purpose. This repository will be used for archiving some critical (at least for me) C++ features.

The update routine is once per-day. You are free to issue something in the issue blank to notice me of my code error if I made some mistakes. This program should be available to run with VS2022, I don't think it would support Linux or MacOS, but you could copy&paste my code to your local machine for testing the features.

### Current Log:
